# Introduction
This repo demonstrates a Sudoku validation using CSV files as Sudoku grids with JavaScript programming language.
In order to receive a CSV file, there was used the HTML `<input>` element and parse the content as a JavaScript `array` and validate it as the Sudoku's rules are. <br />
PS. the code was written in Visual Studio Code Editor.

# How to use
Before proceeding to the testing of the code, I suggest you download the 'files' folder that contains the Sudoku grids saved as .cvs files!
- Open the index.html file in any browser you want!
- Click on the 'Choose File' button and choose one of the files previously downloaded,
- Now click on the 'Validate' button.

Below the page it will be visible the Sudoku you selected and True if the Sudoku is valid or False if the Sudoku is not valid.
